# sliced.sh
A Chrome Extension that plays Chess on chess.com using Stockfish. Complete with a fancy UI, humanizer, and licensing.

I already finished this project and I will upload it to GitHub here soon so everyone can use it.

The "humanizer" created for this project is nearly impossible to differentiate from a real player.

You can easily adjust the following settings for your Chess client:
* ELO Rating (700-4700): How "skilled" the client will be when calculating moves.
* ThinkAhead Moves (1-14): How many moves the client will predict in the move calculation.
* Move Speed (0-20s): If using Auto-Move, how long the client will wait before making the move.
* Ghost (Toggle): Humanizes your gameplay and move speed to evade bans and play like a human.
* Highlight Move (Toggle): Highlights the move that the client has calculated.
* Auto-Move (Toggle): Automatically performs the calculated move after the Move Speed.
* Auto-Queue (Toggle): Automatically queues for the next game when your current game finishes.
* Keybinds (all adjustable):
* [SPACE] - Play calculated move
* [A] - Quick-disable extension
* [Q] - Text-to-Speech calculated move

During my trials, I managed to achieve the Grandmaster rating on chess.com utilizing the suite of humanizing features built into this cheat client.
